# TrustGate

> Trust-Gated USDC Payments for the Agentic Economy

TrustGate is a payment layer for autonomous agents on Arc. Depositors fund a pooled USDC balance, set per-agent spending caps, and delegate routing to an onchain trust score. Each claim settles instantly, time-locks for 24 hours, or holds in escrow — picked deterministically from the agent's tier. The result is sub-cent agent payments with reputation gating that lives entirely on the chain that settles the money.

---

## The Problem

- AI agents need sub-cent micropayments at high frequency.
- Traditional L1 gas fees ($2 – $5 per tx) make this economically impossible.
- ERC-20 `approve()` is all-or-nothing — there is no trust layer for agent-to-agent commerce.
- Any agent that registers can claim against any allowance, with no reputation gate on the settlement path.

## The Solution

- **Onchain trust scoring from real Arc activity** — transactions, USDC balance, contract interactions, and contract deployments combine into a 0 – 100 integer score.
- **Circle Nanopayments** for sub-cent USDC settlement on Arc, where USDC is the native gas token.
- **Trust tier routing** — `HIGH` settles instantly, `MEDIUM` time-locks 24 hours, `LOW` holds in escrow, `BLOCKED` reverts.
- **99.97% cost reduction** versus standard L1 gas — about $0.0008 per claim on Arc versus $2 – $5 on Ethereum mainnet.

## How It Works

1. **Depositor funds TrustGate.** Approve USDC to the contract, call `deposit(amount)` to credit a pooled balance.
2. **Set per-agent allowances.** `setAgentAllowance(agent, maxSpend)` caps every agent independently.
3. **Agent registers** via `AgentRegistry.registerAgent(agent, metadataURI)`. Permissionless.
4. **Agent claims** via `TrustGate.claim(depositor, amount)`. Atomic: read tier, debit allowance, settle.
5. **Score determines routing** — tier is read from `TrustScoring` in the same transaction:

```
       ┌───────────────────────────────┐
       │  TrustGate.claim(deposit, x)  │
       └──────────────┬────────────────┘
                      ▼
              read tier (onchain)
                      │
        ┌─────────┬───┴────┬──────────────────┐
        ▼         ▼        ▼                  ▼
     BLOCKED    LOW     MEDIUM         HIGH / HIGH_ELITE
      revert  escrow  24h time-lock     instant transfer
```

## Trust Scoring

Every score is computed deterministically from Arc onchain activity. No oracle, no manual input.

| Transaction count | Points | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | 0 | BLOCKED — wallet rejected |
| 1 – 10 | 20 | Newly active |
| 11 – 30 | 40 | Light usage |
| 31 – 60 | 60 | Regular usage |
| 61 – 100 | 75 | High usage |
| 100+ | 85 | Power user |

| Bonus signal | Threshold | Bonus |
|---|---|---|
| USDC balance | > 100 USDC | +5 |
| Contract interactions | 3 – 9 | +5 |
| Contract interactions | 10 – 99 | +7 |
| Contract interactions | 100+ | +15 |
| Contract deployments | 1+ | +10 |

**Cap rules:** hard cap at 97 unless contract interactions ≥ 100. Maximum score is 100. Zero transactions returns 0 regardless of any other signal.

| Tier | Score | Payment behavior |
|---|---|---|
| `BLOCKED` | 0 | Claim reverts |
| `LOW` | 1 – 39 | Escrowed — depositor approval required |
| `MEDIUM` | 40 – 74 | Time-locked 24h, depositor can cancel |
| `HIGH` | 75 – 97 | Instant settlement |
| `HIGH_ELITE` | 98 – 100 | Instant settlement, marked verified |

## Architecture

- **`TrustGate.sol`** — pooled USDC ledger, per-agent allowances, tier-routed claim settlement. The user-facing entry point.
- **`AgentRegistry.sol`** — permissionless agent enrollment with Active / Suspended / Deactivated lifecycle. msg.sender becomes agent owner.
- **`TrustScoringPlaintext.sol`** — onchain trust scores (uint64) with HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW tier lookups. FHE variant exists for Zama-compatible chains.
- **Oracle API** — public, payable HTTP service that returns a typed score for any Arc wallet. 0.001 USDC per query, settled through the x402 payment standard.
- **Frontend** — Next.js 14 dashboard, oracle page, live agents view, demo simulator, full docs.

## Oracle API

Base URL: `http://38.49.216.201:3001`

Two paid endpoints, settled via the x402 payment standard (HTTP 402 with payment instructions, replay with `X-Payment` header carrying the proof).

- `GET /trust/:address` — score, tier, recommendation, breakdown, queriedAt, network, source. 0.001 USDC.
- `POST /trust/batch` — up to 10 addresses in one call, charged 0.001 USDC per address.
- `GET /health` — liveness probe, no payment required.

```ts
const ORACLE = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_ORACLE_URL!;

// Step 1 — unpaid challenge
const challenge = await fetch(`${ORACLE}/trust/${address}`);
if (challenge.status === 402) {
  const requirement = await challenge.json();
  // Step 2 — settle 0.001 USDC on Arc to requirement.recipient
  const txHash = await sendUsdc(requirement);
  // Step 3 — replay with X-Payment proof
  const paid = await fetch(`${ORACLE}/trust/${address}`, {
    headers: { "X-Payment": btoa(JSON.stringify({ txHash })) },
  });
  const trust = await paid.json();
  if (trust.tier === "HIGH" || trust.tier === "HIGH_ELITE") {
    // proceed instantly
  }
}
```
